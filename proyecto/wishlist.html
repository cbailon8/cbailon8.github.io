      <h2 class="mt-4">DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED</h2>
      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        Remastered version of the first Dark Souls, and an absolute masterpiece. I have completed the game at least 3
        times, but the replayability it's huge, and what can I say, the pain of
        Dark Souls is fun. And this version includes the DLC, which it's one of the best segments of the game and the
        story of this first title.

      <h2 class="mt-4">DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin</h2>
      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        Remastered version of the Dark Souls II, which includes all 3 DLCs for this game. This game is... controversial
        to say the least, because it's really different from the usual Dark Souls. And in a sincere opinion, as much as
        I hated playing this game, the experience is incredible. It's definitely the worst entry of the series, but
        still a much better game than current-day releases.

      <h2 class="mt-4">DARK SOULS™ III</h2>
      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        The one and only Dark Souls I haven't experienced yet, but another masterpiece. Brought the best from the first
        title and even adopted elements from the gameplay and lore from the second one. The best way to close a series.
        This version doesn't include DLCs, they have to be bought separately.

      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        Another release from FromSoftware, developer of Dark Souls, and another title of the Souls genre. A game with a
        different gameplay style from the usual Dark Souls, but with mostly the same death penalties. An absolute must
        play for fans, and I want to play it. It even won the Game of the Year award, so yeah, the public approves.

      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        Latest release from developer FromSoftware, and Game of the Year 2022. They surpassed themselves with this
        Souls-like open-world RPG. It's enough with medieval themes to pick my interest, but this game goes beyond that,
        picking elements from their other titles like Bloodborne and Sekiro, making their ultimate work and sort of love
        letter to what they've created.

      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        After 15+ years, we didn't get Half-Life 3, but we got something awesome indeed. The good and the bad part of
        this game is that is a VR experience, but Valve really knows how to push the boundaries of technology with their
        engines. The most inmersive VR game yet, and a Half-Life title to keep us alive until (hopefully) Half-Life 3
        sees the light of day.

      <h2 class="mt-4">Grand Theft Auto V</h2>
      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        A classic series of open-world RPG games where you are technically the bad guy? I mean, you play as a criminal,
        so it's bad? It's still fun anyways, and this last title it's so iconic after almost a decade. I have the game
        bought on another platform, but Steam has its advantages.

      <p class="text-start mt-4">
        Persona is a spin-off series from the Shin Megami Tensei games. I hadn't seen a single Persona title before this
        one, but it caught my attention. Even if the art style isn't particularly my favorite, it's still pretty cool.
        And the OSTs are absolutely bangers. I'm sure this will be a very good introduction to this series. And this
        games touch topics that are actually really sensitive IRL, so it would really be an experience.
